# Tax-Sale-Properties

## Configuration

In main.py update the FILEPATH and FILENAME that you want for your csv results

---

This will pull the first 10,000 records from the taxsales.lgbs.com API and puts them in a CSV file.

The program only takes a few seconds to run, and will output the full filepath on completion

Thanks Guys,
